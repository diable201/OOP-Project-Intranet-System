# OOP Final Project
## About Project
Project - university system **INTRANET**. We have classes (superclasses, subclasses, abstract classes), interfaces, enumerations, own exceptions, patterns, etc. - all techniques we have studied.
Before coding we designed our system - create an architecture using UML diagrams (Use case, Class Diagrams). You can find them in [UML Diagrams](https://github.com/diable201/OOP-Project-Intranet-System/tree/master/Uml_Diagrams) folder.
